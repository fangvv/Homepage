The Systems and Networking Laboratory (SyNergyï¼ŒAKA 1 + 1 > 2) at BJTU engages in a wide range of experimental and theoretical research. Our current projects span Mobile Cloud Computing, Edge Computing, Data Center Networks, Internet of Things, Indoor Localization, Mobile Apps, Distributed Optimization Algorithms, Blockchain, Big Data, and Deep Space Network. Our laboratory consists of one faculty, several affiliated researchers and about 10 graduate students and undergraduate students.

Our laboratory is affiliated with [Institute of Information Communication Networks](http://icn.bjtu.edu.cn), [School of Computer and Information Technology](http://scit.bjtu.edu.cn), [Beijing Jiaotong University](http://www.bjtu.edu.cn).

Now, we have some working groups on [Edge Computing](https://fangvv.gitee.io/homepage/Edgecomp/), [Indoor Localization](https://fangvv.gitee.io/homepage/IndoorLoc/), and [Blockchain Systems](https://fangvv.gitee.io/homepage/BlockchainBJTU/).

We know that currently there are a lot of buzz words in the CS and IT area, but there are still some people who do interesting things in the area of systems and networking at top-ranked universitiies (e.g., [Yale](https://cpsc.yale.edu/research/computer-systems-and-networking), [UCSD](https://www.sysnet.ucsd.edu/sysnet/), and [Cornell](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/research/systems)) and cutting-edge companies (e.g., [MSR](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/research-area/systems-and-networking/) and [Facebook](https://research.fb.com/category/systems-and-networking/)).
