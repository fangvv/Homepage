The Systems and Networking Laboratory (SyNergyï¼ŒAKA 1 + 1 > 2) at BJTU engages in a wide range of experimental and theoretical research. Our current projects span Internet-of-Things, Mobile Computing, Indoor Localization, Cloud-Network-End Resource Scheduling, Edge AI, DNN/GNN Compression and Acceleration, Reinforcement Learning, and AI applications. Our laboratory consists of one faculty, several affiliated researchers and more than 10 graduate students.

Now, we have some working groups on [Edge Computing](https://fangvv.github.io/Homepage/Edgecomp/){:target="_blank"}, [Indoor Localization](https://fangvv.github.io/Homepage/IndoorLoc/){:target="_blank"}, and [Blockchain Systems](https://fangvv.github.io/Homepage/BlockchainBJTU/){:target="_blank"}.

We know that currently there are a lot of buzz words in the CS and IT area, but there are still some people who do interesting things in the area of systems and networking at top-ranked universities (e.g., [Yale](https://cpsc.yale.edu/research/computer-systems-and-networking){:target="_blank"}, [UCSD](https://www.sysnet.ucsd.edu/sysnet/){:target="_blank"}, and [Cornell](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/research/systems){:target="_blank"}) and cutting-edge companies (e.g., [MSR](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/research-area/systems-and-networking/) and [Facebook](https://research.fb.com/category/systems-and-networking/){:target="_blank"}).
